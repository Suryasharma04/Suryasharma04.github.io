                        Namaste! Thank you for visiting the page :)

                        I am Surya Sharma, eighteen-years-old, from India. Before you read any further, I would want you to have a smile on your face and have a relaxed mind :) Take three mindful breathes, and go on! </p>



                    <p class="text center">
                        Photography wasn't something I was interested in until I turned twelve. Initially, when I started to click photos, they were grainy and over-exposed, even the editing looked funny, but it didn't bother since I was overjoyed. What mattered was the fact that I initiated an activity I had no prior interest or experience. Of course, there were several manuals and youtube tutorials for a beginner photographer, but it was constant practice and experiment that eventually made me better at my work. </p>



                    <p>

                        Photography has become an inspiring hobby to me; it is more than capturing people and moments. This activity is a medium that changed my perspective towards life. It taught me how nature can be delicate and violent, how mundane non-living object can deliver a strong message, how beautiful and contagious a person's smile can be.

                        Subsequently, I started filming videos and uploaded them on Youtube. Initially, I filmed clumsy videos with my friends and family, but after a few years, I filmed some cinematic videos. The essence of these activities was that simple things in life bring immense joy. </p>



                    <p> In early 2020, I indulged myself in Graphic design. It was yet another activity that was new to me. As time passed, I made several designs and, as a result, they got better, but the problem was that I couldn't find my style. Turns out that copying other's design would refine my techniques, but it won't lead me to my original style.

                        To find what I wanted to draw, I took a break from gadgets and social media. This led me to realize how tangled-up my mind was and it was a break from temptations that I needed.

                    </p>


                    <p> The whole journey has been amazing! What left a mark on my heart was knowing a human can achieve anything if they are determined enough. After all, we are chasing after the same goals, but makes us different is the persistence and perseverance.

                        This blog is merely a portion of my life, several things are left unexplored. This is only the beginning of life, let's see how the future unfolds(not to be anxious). The sole purpose of this blog is to share my views and opinions that can help people mentally and spiritually around the world. :)

                        This quote by Ronald Dahl is worth noting,
                        "Somewhere inside all of us is the power to change the world"

                        Thank you!
                        ♡
